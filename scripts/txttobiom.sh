Usage:
txttobiom.sh InputOTUTable.txt

Input file must have .txt or .csv extension.  Are you sure you are using
a valid tab-delimited input table?  If yes, then change the file
extension manually and resubmit the input for biom conversion.

A file exists with your input name and .biom extension.  Aborting
