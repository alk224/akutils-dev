## Simple command to concatenate two fastqs
## This is useful for keeping reads in phase while performing some other function
##
## Example command:
## paste -d '' <(echo; sed -n '1,${n;p;}' $1 | sed G) $2 | sed '/^$/d' > $1$2.fq


# check whether user had supplied -h or --help. If yes display help 
	if [[ "$1" == "--help" ]] || [[ "$1" == "-h" ]]; then
	scriptdir="$( cd "$( dirname "$0" )" && pwd )"
	less $scriptdir/docs/concatenate_fastqs.help
		exit 0
	fi 

# if other than two arguments supplied, display usage 
	if [  "$#" -ne 2 ] ;
	then 
		echo "
Usage (order is important):
concatenate_fastqs.sh fastq1 fastq2
		"
		exit 1
	fi 

## Extract fastq basename, extension, and directory for output naming and file direction
	fqextension1="${1##*.}"
	fqextension2="${1##*.}"
	base1=`basename "$1" .$fqextension1`
	base2=`basename "$2" .$fqextension2`
	fqname1="${1%.*}"
	fqname2="${2%.*}"
	fqdir=$(dirname $1)

## concatenation command
	echo "
Concatenating $1 in front of $2
	"
	paste -d '' <(echo; sed -n '1,${n;p;}' $1 | sed G) $2 | sed '/^$/d' > $base1\_$base2.$fqextension1
	wait
	echo "Concatenation completed.
fastq1: $1
fastq2: $2
output: ${base1}_$base2.$fqextension1
	"
exit 0
