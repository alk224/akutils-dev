## Load libraries
library(phyloseq)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(grid)

## Recieve input files from bash
args <- commandArgs(TRUE)

otufile=(args[1])
mapfile=(args[2])
treefile=(args[3])
factor=(args[4])
outdir=(args[5])

## Load data into phyloseq
map=import_qiime_sample_data(mapfile)
tree=read_tree(treefile)
otus=import_biom(otufile,parseFunction=parse_taxonomy_greengenes)
mergedata=merge_phyloseq(otus,tree,map)

## Make detailed tree
detailtree = plot_tree(mergedata,color=factor,label.tips="Species",plot.margin=0.5,ladderize="left",nodelabf=nodeplotboot(),size="abundance",base.spacing=0.03,shape="Class",title="Detailed tree")

## Output pdf graphic
pdf(file=(paste0(outdir,factor,"_detail_tree.pdf")),paper="letter")
plot(detailtree)
dev.off()

## Change pdf resolution like this (doesnt change text size):
#pdf("network.pdf", height = 12, width = 12)

## .png output instead
#png('network.png', height="12")
#plot(networkout)
#dev.off()
